# Octave
This project is a simulation of the redshift effect throught the use of Octave.
This programm can simulate variuos types of redshift:
    1. Doppler Redshift Animation:
         Object oscillates at relativistic speeds (-0.8c to +0.8c)
         Real-time visual effects: Color changes from blue (approaching) to red (receding)
         Dynamic plots: Velocity, redshift, and spectral line shifts over time
         Wave visualization: Shows actual light wave compression/stretching
    2. Cosmological Redshift Animation
         Expanding universe simulation: 8 galaxies moving away over 13.8 billion years
         Hubble diagram evolution: Shows distance-velocity relationship developing
         Scale factor animation: Universe expansion from Big Bang to present
         Multi-galaxy tracking: Each galaxy's redshift evolution over cosmic time
    3. Gravitational Redshift Animation
         Orbital mechanics: Light source orbiting a 2-solar-mass star
         Distance-dependent redshift: Shows how gravitational effects vary with orbital position
         Real orbital dynamics: Proper physics with Kepler's laws
         Spectral line tracking: Wavelength shifts as source orbits
    4. Spectral Line Animation
         Simultaneous comparison: All three redshift effects running together
         Multi-line display: Shows how the same spectral line shifts differently for each effect
         Parameter evolution: Time-varying velocities, distances, and gravitational fields
         Color-coded effects: Red (Doppler), Blue (Cosmological), Green (Gravitational)
    5. Interactive Real-time Demo
         Mouse control: Move cursor to control velocity (horizontal) and distance (vertical)
         Live feedback: Instant spectral line updates as you move the mouse
         Dual parameter control: Simultaneous Doppler and cosmological effects
         Real-time calculations: All physics computed on-the-fly
